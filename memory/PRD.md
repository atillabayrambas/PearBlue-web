# PearBlue Website — PRD

## Original Problem Statement
"Make a website based on everything described in the excel file" — Reference: `Website_Offerte_Template_Sociaal_NL.xlsx` (PearBlue quote template).

PearBlue is a Dutch ICT & Media Design agency ("Your Complete Digital Partner"). Brand: pear + leaves, fresh/fruity/modern. Target: business starters + older-generation entrepreneurs.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 + React Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + framer-motion. NL/EN via LanguageContext.
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Motor (MongoDB async). All routes prefixed `/api`. Starlette `SessionMiddleware` for Zoho OAuth state.
- **Integrations**: Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Emergent LLM key) chatbot, Resend (transactional email), Zoho OAuth 2.0 (Books/Projects/Desk EU DC).
- **Design**: primary `#02C0FF`, Outfit (headings) + Manrope (body).

## Core Requirements
- 5 pages: Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact
- Multi-language NL/EN with browser auto-detect
- Contact form + quote endpoints (Resend delivery)
- Admin CMS for portfolio, messages, GA settings, registrations, reviews
- Zoho-connected client portal (invoices/projects/tickets)
- AI chatbot with rate limiting + analytics dashboard
- Cookie/GDPR banner + GA4 opt-in

## Implemented
### Feb 2026 — Iterations 1–6
- 5-page site, NL/EN switcher, dark/light theme
- Admin CMS (projects, messages, settings, GA4 config)
- Claude 4.6 chatbot (`/api/chat`) with rate limiting + admin AI-cost dashboard
- Cookie banner, GA4 loader (`AnalyticsLoader`), robots.txt, sitemap.xml
- Resend contact + portal notifications
- Zoho OAuth 2.0 portal (Books invoices, Projects, Desk tickets) with token encryption (Fernet)
- Portal client registration flow + admin approve/reject with automated email

### Feb 2026 — Iteration 7 (this session)
- **Client Reviews / Testimonials** — public POST `/api/reviews`, admin CMS tab (`/admin/reviews`) with approve / feature / delete, featured reviews render on the homepage (`FeaturedReviews`), `ReviewForm` exposed inside authenticated `/portal`.
- **Zoho OAuth Redirect URI fix** — frontend callback route `/oauth/zoho/callback` + `POST /api/auth/zoho/exchange` endpoint so the URI matches the Zoho console entries (`http://localhost:3000/oauth/zoho/callback`, `https://pearblue.nl/oauth/zoho/callback`, and the preview URL).
- **Privacy fix** — `GET /api/reviews` no longer accepts `approved` query param; public route always returns only approved reviews. Admin uses `GET /api/reviews/all`.
- **CORS hardening** — replaced wildcard `*` with explicit allow-list (preview URL + pearblue.nl + localhost) so `withCredentials` cookies (Zoho session) actually get set in the browser.
- **XSS-in-admin-email hardening** — HTML-escape user-submitted review name/company/quote in the notification email body.
- **Login-page logo** — Admin + Portal login pages both render `PearBlue logo-10.webp` via the icon-only Logo variant (theme-independent, as requested).
- Testing: pytest 28/28 pass, Playwright frontend end-to-end pass (`/app/test_reports/iteration_7.json`).

## Prioritized Backlog
- **P1** — "Betaal Nu" (Pay Now) button in the Zoho portal: Stripe/iDEAL to pay open Zoho Books invoices directly.
- **P2** — Extract `reviews` and Zoho helpers out of `server.py` (now ~790 lines) into dedicated routers.
- **P2** — Rate-limit / captcha on public `POST /api/reviews` and `POST /api/portal/register` (same spam vector as `/api/contact`).
- **P2** — Pagination on `/api/reviews` and `/api/reviews/all` (currently truncates at 200/500).
- **P2** — Attach `pearblue.nl` domain to Resend sender for deliverability.
- **P3** — Blog/news section for SEO.
- **P3** — Newsletter signup (Resend audiences).

## Test Credentials
- Admin: `admin@pearblue.nl` / `PearBlue2026!` — see `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`.
- Zoho: end-to-end OAuth requires a real user consent; endpoint contracts + redirect URL tested.
